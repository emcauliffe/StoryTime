When scientists marked a pair of dolphins on areas of their bodies not normally visible to them, the aquatic mammals raced to a mirror and twisted their bodies to expose the marks.  Because the bodies of these mammals must be streamlined to move quickly through water, male reproductive organs are inside the body. Body warmth can damage sperm, however. So warm-blooded dolphins have evolved an elaborate heat-exchange system of woven veins and arteries. Veins that carry cooled blood from the tail lower the temperature of interwoven arteries that bring the warmer blood to the testes.  In addition to using sight, dolphins can locate objects by echo. They emit and process as many as 700 clicking sounds per second to detect the size and location of objects hundreds of meters away. This capability is invaluable underwater, where visibility is limited.  Using echolocation, a dolphin can discriminate between objects that differ by as little as 10 percent in volume or surface area, even in noisy environments. See How It Works (below) for a step-by-step explanation of echolocation.  The U.S. Navy has used dolphins to tag deadly mines for detonation. On such missions, dolphins have found softball-size targets at a range of 200 yards or more.  Dolphins give birth to one offspring, called a calf, at a time. At birth a bottlenose dolphin calf is about 3 to 41/3 feet long, and will grow to approximately 13 feet.  Highly sociable, dolphins live in groups called pods. Dolphins from separate pods occasionally interact  Dolphins can empty and refill their lungs in less than 0.2 seconds. As the dolphin breathes, the air leaves its blowhole at speeds of more than 100 mph.  Dolphins must be conscious to breathe. So they shut down only half of their brain at a time and take short naps, floating just below the surface and slowly rising to breathe."}

Here are a few of the most significant past winners.  1952: Eastman Kodak color negative film  The older Technicolor process required heavy, mechanically complex cameras that shot three strips of film--one each for red, green and blue. Kodak's revolutionary single-strip film could be loaded into machines that weighed a fraction as much. The first feature-film usage was in the 1952 western The Lion and the Horse. By 1955, Technicolor cameras were extinct.  1964: Color traveling matte compositing  Shoot a scenic backdrop; shoot an actor against a blue screen; use red filters to create positive and reverse silhouettes of the actor; combine the four layers to create a single image. That's blue-screening. The technique, also known as traveling matte compositing, has been a cornerstone of effects work since its award-winning debut, facilitating effects including the sky-biking in E.T. , the speeder-chasing in Return of the Jedi and the barnstorming in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.  1977: Steadicam  Rocky's signature shot of Sylvester Stallone jogging up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art would have been hopelessly bouncy without this invention. The Steadicam's breakthrough was a balanced, articulated arm--with a motorized stabilizing system of hinges, springs and pulleys--that attached to the camera operator's vest.  1984: Computer graphics  When the Academy awarded a modest Sci-Tech plaque to digital-graphics pioneers John Whitney, Jr., and Gary Demos \"for the practical simulation of motion-picture photography by means of computer-generated images,\" you don't sense that its members knew the magnitude of what was to come. Whitney and Demos contributed to such trailblazing CG projects as Tron (1982) and The Last Starfighter (1984). The Last Starfighter, the first feature film to make use of photorealistic computer graphic images, contained a full 27 minutes of CG effects produced with the help of a Cray XMP supercomputer at a cost of $14 million. Pixar's short animated films of the late 1980s and Jurassic Park in 1993--the projects that the public associates with ushering in the CG era--were still years away."}

Here I am, an old man in a dry month,  Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain.  I was neither at the hot gates  Nor fought in the warm rain  Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,  Bitten by flies, fought. My house is a decayed house,  And the Jew squats on the window sill, the owner,  Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,  Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.  The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;  Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds.  The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,  Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter.                                            \tI an old man,  A dull head among windy spaces.   Signs are taken for wonders.  'We would see a sign!' The word within a word, unable to speak a word,  Swaddled with darkness.  In the juvescence of the year  Came Christ the tiger   In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering judas,  To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk  Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero  With caressing hands, at Limoges  Who walked all night in the next room;   By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;  By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room  Shifting the candles; Fr√§ulein von Kulp  Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door.    \tVacant shuttles  Weave the wind.  I have no ghosts,  An old man in a draughty house  Under a windy knob.   After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now  History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors  And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,  Guides us by vanities.  Think now  She gives when our attention is distracted  And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions  That the giving famishes the craving.  Gives too late  What's not believed in, or is still believed,  In memory only, reconsidered passion.  Gives too soon  Into weak hands, what's thought can be dispensed with  Till the refusal propagates a fear.  Think  Neither fear nor courage saves us.  Unnatural vices  Are fathered by our heroism.  Virtues  Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.  These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.   The tiger springs in the new year.  Us he devours.  Think at last  We have not reached conclusion, when I  Stiffen in a rented house.  Think at last  I have not made this show purposelessly  And it is not by any concitation  Of the backward devils.  I would meet you upon this honestly.  I that was near your heart was removed therefrom  To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.  I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it  Since what is kept must be adulterated?  I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:  How should I use it for your closer contact?   These with a thousand small deliberations  Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,  Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,  With pungent sauces, multiply variety  In a wilderness of mirrors.  What will the spider do  Suspend its operations, will the weevil  Delay?  De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled  Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear  In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits  Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,  White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,  And an old man driven by the Trades  To a sleepy corner.                                      Tenants of the house,  Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season."}

Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor, We'll swim in milk and honey till we drown.  The winter will be short, the summer long, The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot, Tasting of cider and of scuppernong; All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all. The squirrels in their silver fur will fall Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.  2  The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold. The misted early mornings will be cold; The little puddles will be roofed with glass. The sun, which burns from copper into brass, Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.  Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover; A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year; The spring begins before the winter's over. By February you may find the skins Of garter snakes and water moccasins Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.  3  When April pours the colors of a shell Upon the hills, when every little creek Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell, When strawberries go begging, and the sleek Blue plums lie open to the blackbird's beak, We shall live well‚Äìwe shall live very well.  The months between the cherries and the peaches Are brimming cornucopias which spill Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black; Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches We'll trample bright persimmons, while you kill Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.  4  Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones There's something in this richness that I hate. I love the look, austere, immaculate, Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones. There's something in my very blood that owns Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate, A thread of water, churned to milky spate Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.  I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray, Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves; That spring, briefer than apple-blossom's breath, Summer, so much too beautiful to stay, Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves, And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.","__v":{"$numberDouble":"0"}}

He was trying to demonstrate his theory ‚Äî which Albert Einstein later updated and added to his theory of relativity ‚Äî that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their size. Now, after spending two years dropping two objects of different mass into a free fall in a satellite, a group of scientists has concluded that Galileo and Einstein were right: The objects fell at a rate that was within two-trillionths of a percent of each other, according to a new study. This effect has been confirmed time and time again, as has Einstein's theory of relativity ‚Äî yet scientists still aren't convinced that there isn't some kind of exception somewhere. \"Scientists have always had a difficult time actually accepting that nature should behave that way,\" said senior author Peter Wolf, research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research's Paris Observatory.  That's because there are still inconsistencies in scientists' understanding of the universe.  \"Quantum mechanics and general relativity, which are the two basic theories all of physics is built on today ...are still not unified,\" Wolf told Live Science. What's more, although scientific theory says the universe is made up mostly of dark matter and dark energy, experiments have failed to detect these mysterious substances. \"So, if we live in a world where there's dark matter around that we can't see, that might have an influence on the motion of [objects],\" Wolf said. That influence would be \"a very tiny one,\" but it would be there nonetheless. So, if scientists see test objects fall at different rates, that \"might be an indication that we're actually looking at the effect of dark matter,\" he added. Wolf and an international group of researchers ‚Äî including scientists from France's National Center for Space Studies and the European Space Agency ‚Äî set out to test Einstein and Galileo's foundational idea that no matter where you do an experiment, no matter how you orient it and what velocity you're moving at through space, the objects will fall at the same rate.  The researchers put two cylindrical objects ‚Äî one made of titanium and the other platinum ‚Äî inside each other and loaded them onto a satellite. The orbiting satellite was naturally \"falling\" because there were no forces acting on it, Wolf said. They suspended the cylinders within an electromagnetic field and dropped the objects for 100 to 200 hours at a time. From the forces the researchers needed to apply to keep the cylinders in place inside the satellite, the team deduced how the cylinders fell and the rate at which they fell, Wolf said.  And, sure enough, the team found that the two objects fell at almost exactly the same rate, within two-trillionths of a percent of each other. That suggested Galileo was correct. What's more, they dropped the objects at different times during the two-year experiment and got the same result, suggesting Einstein's theory of relativity was also correct. Their test was an order of magnitude more sensitive than previous tests. Even so, the researchers have published only 10% of the data from the experiment, and they hope to do further analysis of the rest. Not satisfied with this mind-boggling level of precision, scientists have put together several new proposals to do similar experiments with two orders of magnitude greater sensitivity, Wolf said. Also, some physicists want to conduct similar experiments at the tiniest scale, with individual atoms of different types, such as rubidium and potassium, he added."}

This now is too lamentable a face for a man, Some abject louse asking leave to be,cringing for it, Some milk-nosed maggot, blessing what lets it wrig to its hole.  This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage, Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat.  This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea, Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they go.  This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label, And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog's-lard.  This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry, Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they show nothing but their whites, Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the turn'd-in nails, The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground while he speculates well.  This face is bitten by vermin and worms, And this is some murderer's knife, with a half-pull'd scabbard.

I see your rounded, never-erased flow, I see 'neath the rims of your haggard and mean disguises.  Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling fores of fishes or rats, You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.

Out of this face emerge banners and horses‚ÄìO superb! I see what is coming, I see the high pioneer-caps, I see the staves of runners clearing the way, I hear victorious drums.  This face is a life-boat, This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no odds of the rest, This face is flavor'd fruit, ready for eating, This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme of all good.  These faces bear testimony, slumbering or awake, They show their descent from the Master himself.  Off the word I have spoken, I except not one‚Äìred, white, black, are all deific, In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a thousand years.  Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me, Tall and sufficient stand behind, and make signs to me, I read the promise and patiently wait.

Whist! I am fully content.  Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day morning, It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences, It hangs thin by the sassafras, the wild-cherry, and the cat-brier under them.  I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree, I heard what the singers were singing so long, Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white froth and the water-blue,  Behold a woman! She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky.  She sits in an armchair, under the shaded porch of the farmhouse, The sun just shines on her old white head.  Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen, Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-daughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel.  The melodious character of the earth, The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go, and does not wish to go, The justified mother of men."}

Now, thousands of years later, an analysis of the ancient DNA found in their bones has revealed secrets about the people who lived there many millennia ago, according to a new study.  Perhaps the most surprising finding is that these children are not related to the modern-day Bantu-speaking cultures that reside in the region today, the researchers said. Rather, the Stone Age youngsters are genetically closer to the present-day hunter-gatherer groups of Central Africa, which are not closely related to Bantu speaking groups, the researchers found. This realization and others, including that a previously unknown \"ghost\" population contributed genetically to the people who live in Africa today, is shedding light on what is still the most genetically diverse region for humans in the world today, the researchers said. Ancient rock shelter  Researchers have found countless artifacts and 18 human burials at the Shum Laka rock shelter, which people have used for at least 30,000 years. But the new study focused on the burials of four children, who lived as the Stone Age transitioned into the Metal Age (also called the Stone-to-Metal Age) in western Central Africa.  This included the remains of a 4-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy found in a double-burial dating to about 8,000 years ago. The researchers also analyzed the DNA of a 4-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy found in neighboring burials dating to about 3,000 years ago, during the late Stone-to-Metal Age.  Although they lived thousands of years apart, these children were distant cousins, the researchers found. About one-third of their DNA came from ancestors who were more closely related to hunter and gatherers in western Central Africa. The other two-thirds came from an ancient source in West Africa, including a \"long lost ghost population of modern humans that we didn't know about before,\" study senior researcher David Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard University, told Science magazine. The DNA of these cousins upended a previously held idea. Until now, researchers thought that the Bantu-speaking peoples, which includes several hundred indigenous groups in sub-Saharan Africa, originated in this area of Central Africa, before radiating out across the lower half of Africa, which includes central, western central, eastern and southern Africa. This idea was thought to explain why most of the people from these regions are closely related to each other.  But the new genetic analyses show that's not the case. The inhabitants of Shum Laka were not the ancestors of  Bantu-speaking people at least according to the DNA of these four children.  \"The finding that the Shum Laka individuals are most related to present day rainforest hunter-gatherers and not ancestors of Bantu-speakers is surprising given that Shum Laka was long considered by archeologist[s] as the site where Bantu-speaker culture [was] developing in situ,\" Carina Schlebusch, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, who wasn't involved with the study, told Live Science in an email.  \"However, as the authors mentioned in the article, it might be that multiple groups used the site,\" Schlebusch said. This means that the Bantu's ancestors might have used the site, but it's not shown in these particular burials.  Ancient genetics The genetic analyses revealed a handful of other findings about the ancient people of Cameroon. For instance, one of the boy's genomes revealed that he had the oldest branch of the Y chromosome, which shows that the oldest lineage of human males was present in Cameroon for at least 8,000 years, and possibly much longer, the researchers said. The children's genomes also showed signs of admixture, suggesting that the children's ancestors mated with people from different populations, the researchers found.  In addition, the analysis suggests that there are at least four major human lineages, which date to between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. This realization is unique to this dataset, and hasn't been found from previous genetic studies, the researchers said. The scientists also found another set of four sub-branches  of human lineages that date to between 60,000 and 80,000 years ago. This includes the lineage that gave rise to all modern non-Africans, the researchers said. \"It is a nice paper and it is a welcome addition to the growing aDNA [ancient DNA] database of Africa,\" Schlebusch said. \"It is especially valuable to get aDNA from West Africa, where it is well know[n] that the preservation of human remains [is] very bad due to the acidic soils.\" That said, the researchers could have done even more with their unique dataset, she said. For instance, they could have visualized effective population sizes over time, Schlebusch said. She added that \"the findings regarding the deep African population structure are interesting, but we definitely need more testing of possible models and most probably more aDNA results before we will be able to disentangle signals.\" The study, led by scientists at Harvard Medical School, was published online today (Jan. 22) in the journal Nature.

Oh, do not ask, \"What is it?\" Let us go and make our visit.  In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo.  The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes, Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.  And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, Rubbing its back upon the window-panes; There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate; Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before the taking of a toast and tea.

And would it have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while, To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it toward some overwhelming question, To say: \"I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\"‚Äî If one, settling a pillow by her head, ‚Å†Should say: \"That is not what I meant at all; ‚Å†That is not it, at all.\"  And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while, After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor‚Äî And this, and so much more?‚Äî It is impossible to say just what I mean! But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say: ‚Å†\"That is not it at all, ‚Å†That is not what I meant, at all.\"   ‚Å†*‚Å†*‚Å†*‚Å†*  No!

How close we are to destroying ourselves registers in the nearness of the clock's hands to midnight ‚Äî the hour of absolute extinction. In 2019, the clock's \"timekeepers\" with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) fixed the hands at 2 minutes to midnight; that time, set in 2018, is the closest the clock's hands have come to doomsday since 1953, when the U.S. and the Soviet Union detonated the first hydrogen bombs. And now the fictional clock ticks forward; its hands rest at 100 seconds to midnight, BAS President and CEO Rachel Bronson announced today (Jan. 23) in Washington, D.C. This new time indicates that humanity has entered \"into a realm of a two-minute warning,\" in which every precious second will count if we want to forestall global catastrophe, Bronson said. \"Danger is high, and the margin for error is low,\" she said. When the Doomsday Clock was introduced in 1947, the primary threat to humanity was nuclear weapons. That threat still exists today, but it has company: catastrophic climate change and disruptive technologies are also considered by BAS in their assessment of whether humanity is safer or more at risk than we were the year before.  In 2019, nuclear and climate conditions continued to deteriorate, and decisions by global leaders not only failed to reduce the damage ‚Äî they made dangerous situations worse.  \"Over the last two years, we have seen influential leaders denigrate and discard the most effective methods for addressing complex threats,\" Bronson said. Prior nuclear treaties are crumbling, new agreements between the U.S. and Russia are no closer than they were a year ago, and negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea regarding nuclear weapons reduction have been abandoned, according to Bronson. The shadow of nuclear war also hovers over the Middle East; since 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal with Iran, tensions between the two nations have simmered. They finally erupted when a U.S. strike killed Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3. Days later, Iran threatened withdrawal from the nuclear deal, and Trump proposed that the deal's other signatories ‚Äî Germany, France and the United Kingdom ‚Äî should also abandon the deal, though they have not done so, Business Insider reported.   While the Doomsday Clock was set in November, prior to the U.S. actions against Iran, the events of recent weeks only confirm the board's assessment months earlier: \"that we are rapidly losing our bearings in a nuclear weapons landscape that may expand beyond our recognition,\" Bronson said. Disruptive technologies The development of artificial intelligence (AI) for use in weapons \"that make kill decisions,\" and its use in military control and command systems is another new cause for concern, said Robert Latiff, a retired U.S. Air Force major general and an adjunct faculty member with the John J. Reilly Center for Science, Technology, and Values at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.  Even space has become \"a new arena for weapons development\" with the announcement of the U.S. Space Force, a new division of the U.S. armed forces that includes \"preparing for space combat\" as one of its primary goals, according to Latiff. Equally troubling is the growing deluge of \"fake news\" (and its support by prominent politicians) and the rise of \"deepfake\" footage ‚Äî digitally manipulated video that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from the real thing. By blurring the lines between truth and fiction, these technologies disrupt information and trust, introducing \"a dangerous global instability,\" Latiff said.  Heat waves, ice loss, fires 2019 also brought alarming new evidence of climate change's momentum, and demonstrated its destructive power. In fact, humanity's disruption of climate on land and in the oceans is \"unprecedented,\" according to a report released in September 2019 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body that evaluates the impacts of climate change. Globally, the year was the second hottest since record keeping began in 1880, and the past decade was the warmest on record, NASA reported earlier this month. July 2019 smashed records as the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, after a sweltering heat wave baked countries across Europe and then flowed over Greenland, where it melted 217 billion tons (197 billion metric tons) of ice. Ocean temperatures are warmer than they've been at any point in human history, and they're heating up at an accelerating rate. The world's thickest mountain glacier is retreating, the Sahara Desert expanded by about 10%, and the Arctic's most stable sea ice is disappearing.  Severe drought in Australia, also linked to climate change, fueled devastating brushfires that blazed across the continent over recent months. The flames destroyed thousands of homes, damaged fragile ecosystems and killed an estimated 1.25 billion animals, according to the World Wildlife Fund. And in a report published in August 2019 in the journal Science, scientists warned that rising sea levels, extreme weather events and other disasters such as famines and fires caused by climate change could soon make coastal cities uninhabitable, displacing up to 1 billion people. \"The state of the world does, indeed, demand an emergency response,\" Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute in Sweden, said at the BAS announcement.  Though years have passed since the historic Paris Agreement, a global compact to reduce fossil fuel emissions, was signed in 2016, \"we're far off course\" from achieving its goals, Kartha said. However, recent surges in climate activism ‚Äî despite politicians' inaction and widespread disinformation campaigns that discredit climate science ‚Äî suggest that the public finds the climate emergency too dire to ignore, he added. \"An environment of misery\" While the Doomsday Clock marks the stroke of midnight as the hour of humanity's annihilation, in reality, the multiple threats of nuclear weapons, climate change, pandemics and weaponized technology will more likely ring in an apocalypse that \"probably won't be quick or final,\" futurist and author Jamais Cascio wrote in October 2019 for the journal BAS. \"It will be an environment of misery, not an event or an end point,\" Cascio wrote. \"Although worst-case scenarios theoretically make it easier to prevent dire outcomes, in the case of slow-moving apocalypses such as climate change, it's difficult for humans to envision the scale of the problem and to imagine how we will actually experience it,\" he explained. Nevertheless, however large the threat of annihilation looms, that doesn't mean all hope is gone, Cascio added. \"If we can't stop the disaster, perhaps we can minimize the harm,\" Cascio said. \"Most important, acknowledging the sheer resilience of humanity might be the kick needed to keep fighting, even when things look lost.\""}

Abundant everywhere but Antarctica, there are about 3,200 species of this cicada (Cicadoidea) and leafhopper (Cicadellidae) relative. Each individual measures between two and twenty millimeters. They live for a few months, during which they feed on sap. They have some social characteristics but no extraordinary capacities distinguishing them from other social insects.  What separates treehoppers is their headgear. Each species has its own model of enlarged and ornate helmet, known to entomologists as a pronotum. Some look like spines, others like leaves or ants. Still others have forms too bizarre for the Oxford English Dictionary to name. Even the hats at a royal wedding would fall short of these helmets' extravagance. And, unlike all those princesses and duchesses, treehoppers have to wear their millinery 24/7, from birth until death.  The treehoppers' helmet is hard to justify from a selectionist standpoint. Schlepping it around adds a considerable energy burden, so it ought to do something important. What might be its useful function? Courtship, the usual suspect when it comes to exaggerated features, is eliminated by the absence of sexual dimorphism. Helmets are equally distributed in both genders; one can distinguish males and females only by their genitalia. Aerodynamics, another possible function, defies common sense. While some helmets are streamlined, others are decidedly not. And, in any case, the extra weight is detrimental to flying. Camouflage is a stronger bet but also problematic. Even in cases where the helmet's form or colors fit the environment, a helmetless insect with the same colors and an otherwise identical form would be better equipped for hiding, being half the size or smaller. In the absence of smaller mimics, it is reasonable to infer that the helmet is not an antipredator tool.  Daniel Milo's new book \"Good Enough\" is on sale now.Courtesy of Harvard University Press  So, what is the helmet for? Benjamin Prud'homme and Nicolas Gompel offer an answer based on their careful study of the treehoppers: nothing. Based on the discovery that the helmet is a third pair of wings that lost their original function, they turn to Darwin's thesis on vestigial organs. The helmets \"illustrate how a structure or an organ, relieved from its original function, is 'left to the free play of the various laws of growth' . . . and provides a new substrate for morphological diversification.\" But contrary to typical vestigial organs such as the human appendix, the python's pelvis, and the whale's leg bone, which degenerate over time, the treehoppers' helmets continue to evolve to an ex- travagant scale. Some measure twice or thrice the size of the rest of the body to which they are attached. The treehoppers illustrate Romanes's observation that specific traits that differentiate species from one another may be useful to scientists but are useless to the species themselves.  The miserly accountant appears to have fallen asleep on duty some 3,200 times. We cannot credit this outcome to nature's bias toward excess. That bias applies only to traits that are important to species, not to vestigial organs; where preservation has no effect on survival, there is no need for factors of safety and therefore no increased probability of runaway growth. Vestigial organs should shrivel, not expand. Yet in the long term, and for reasons unfathomable, the bigger and freakier prevailed. The results are artistic masterpieces, but from a selectionist point of view, they are pure heresy. More than three thousand white elephants? That is a lot of exceptions.  The big question surrounding the helmets is one we have encountered before. How can such excess be viable? How is it that this useless, overweight blob meets the eighteenth-century French anatomist Marie Fran√ßois Xavier Bichat's definition of life: \"the set of functions which resist death\"? We need not doubt the treehoppers' will to live. As Baruch Spinoza put it, \"Each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being.\" Another way to think about this is to recognize that organisms resist change, death being the ultimate case. Change is met with negative feedback, which brings a system back to equilibrium, as opposed to positive feedback, which distances the system from the original equilibrium.  There are three mechanisms that, in concert, can explain how this perseverance works in living organisms: facilitated variation, homeostasis, and norm of reaction. Facilitated variation affirms 3 billion years of natural selection followed by 400 million years of risks, follies, and otherwise idiosyncratic development; homeostasis preserves the interior milieu of the organism against external and internal perturbations; and the norm of reaction means that every genotype can produce a range of phenotypes without new genetic variation. Collectively, these mechanisms form a natural safety net that allows the mediocre to survive and thrive.4 This theory takes for granted the distinction between the two evolutions. During the first, occurring over the course of those 3 billion years of life on earth, adaptation amid competition produced fundamental changes in the nature of life. During the second, the safety net is so robust that all species are good enough to survive and experiment with selectively neutral variations in size, shape, and other aspects of appearance. I should stress that this safety-net theory is just that‚Äîa theory. I cannot prove that it explains our observations of nature, but I believe it provides a useful complement to prevailing wisdom, filling in its gaps.  As should be clear, natural selection has a critical role in this theory: it is the engineer behind the safety net. But this role lasted \"just\" three billion years. Since the Middle Cambrian period, positive selection has been reduced to the role of architect and designer, whereas natural elimination (natural tolerance) pre- dominates. CCCP and homeostasis were fixed and optimized through a selective process, after which species were free to play with appearance and scale. The extraordinary diversity of body forms found in the Burgess Shale‚Äîfossils dating back 508 million years‚Äîdemonstrates the power of the fixed infrastructure. The safety net was so strong that the genetic lottery could produce all sorts of sustainable deviation. The treehoppers' helmets prove that deviations must be extreme before, as our epigraph puts it, \"the sentence of unfitness is pronounced and the penalty of extermination paid.\" The safety net is nature's assurance to the fittest and the mediocre alike. Excellence does not hurt, nor is it necessary.  Even the mediocre may be good enough. Nature's safety net benefits humans, of course. But there is something special about us, for we have won the final arbitrament of life. We must have an edge over everybody else. If my argument holds, this edge was not selected. Our victory was won by an organ that imposes huge selective burdens, and in any case, no one wins where competition is endless."}

By unclosing your eyes so suddenly you seem to have surprised the personages of your dream in full convocation round your bed, and catch one broad glance at them before they can flit into obscurity. Or, to vary the metaphor, you find yourself for a single instant wide awake in that realm of illusions whither sleep has been the passport, and behold its ghostly inhabitants and wondrous scenery with a perception of their strangeness such as you never attain while the dream is undisturbed. The distant sound of a church-clock is borne faintly on the wind. You question with yourself, half seriously, whether it has stolen to your waking ear from some gray tower that stood within the precincts of your dream. While yet in suspense another clock flings its heavy clang over the slumbering town with so full and distinct a sound, and such a long murmur in the neighboring air, that you are certain it must proceed from the steeple at the nearest corner; You count the strokes‚Äîone, two; and there they cease with a booming sound like the gathering of a third stroke within the bell. If you could choose an hour of wakefulness out of the whole night, it would be this. Since your sober bedtime, at eleven, you have had rest enough to take off the pressure of yesterday's fatigue, while before you, till the sun comes from \"Far Cathay\" to brighten your window, there is almost the space of a summer night‚Äîone hour to be spent in thought with the mind's eye half shut, and two in pleasant dreams, and two in that strangest of enjoyments the forgetfulness alike of joy and woe. The moment of rising belongs to another period of time, and appears so distant that the plunge out of a warm bed into the frosty air cannot yet be anticipated with dismay. Yesterday has already vanished among the shadows of the past; to-morrow has not yet emerged from the future. You have found an intermediate space where the business of life does not intrude, where the passing moment lingers and becomes truly the present; a spot where Father Time, when he thinks nobody is watching him, sits down by the wayside to take breath. Oh that he would fall asleep and let mortals live on without growing older! Hitherto you have lain perfectly still, because the slightest motion would dissipate the fragments of your slumber. Now, being irrevocably awake, you peep through the half-drawn window-curtain, and observe that the glass is ornamented with fanciful devices in frost-work, and that each pane presents something like a frozen dream. There will be time enough to trace out the analogy while waiting the summons to breakfast. Seen through the clear portion of the glass where the silvery mountain-peaks of the frost-scenery do not ascend, the most conspicuous object is the steeple, the white spire of which directs you to the wintry lustre of the firmament. You may almost distinguish the figures on the clock that has just told the hour. Such a frosty sky and the snow-covered roofs and the long vista of the frozen street, all white, and the distant water hardened into rock, might make you shiver even under four blankets and a woollen comforter. Yet look at that one glorious star! Its beams are distinguishable from all the rest, and actually cast the shadow of the casement on the bed with a radiance of deeper hue than moonlight, though not so accurate an outline. You sink down and muffle your head in the clothes, shivering all the while, but less from bodily chill than the bare idea of a polar atmosphere. It is too cold even for the thoughts to venture abroad. You speculate on the luxury of wearing out a whole existence in bed like an oyster in its shell, content with the sluggish ecstasy of inaction, and drowsily conscious of nothing but delicious warmth such as you now feel again. Ah! that idea has brought a hideous one in its train. You think how the dead are lying in their cold shrouds and narrow coffins through the drear winter of the grave, and cannot persuade your fancy that they neither shrink nor shiver when the snow is drifting over their little hillocks and the bitter blast howls against the door of the tomb. That gloomy thought will collect a gloomy multitude and throw its complexion over your wakeful hour. In the depths of every heart there is a tomb and a dungeon, though the lights, the music and revelry, above may cause us to forget their existence and the buried ones or prisoners whom they hide. But sometimes, and oftenest at midnight, those dark receptacles are flung wide open. In an hour like this, when the mind has a passive sensibility, but no active strength‚Äîwhen the imagination is a mirror imparting vividness to all ideas without the power of selecting or controlling them‚Äîthen pray that your griefs may slumber and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain. It is too late. A funeral train comes gliding by your bed in which passion and feeling assume bodily shape and things of the mind become dim spectres to the eye. There is your earliest sorrow, a pale young mourner wearing a sister's likeness to first love, sadly beautiful, with a hallowed sweetness in her melancholy features and grace in the flow of her sable robe. Next appears a shade of ruined loveliness with dust among her golden hair and her bright garments all faded and defaced, stealing from your glance with drooping head, as fearful of reproach: she was your fondest hope, but a delusive one; so call her Disappointment now. A sterner form succeeds, with a brow of wrinkles, a look and gesture of iron authority; there is no name for him unless it be Fatality‚Äîan emblem of the evil influence that rules your fortunes, a demon to whom you subjected yourself by some error at the outset of life, and were bound his slave for ever by once obeying him. See those fiendish lineaments graven on the darkness, the writhed lip of scorn, the mockery of that living eye, the pointed finger touching the sore place in your heart! Do you remember any act of enormous folly at which you would blush even in the remotest cavern of the earth? Then recognize your shame. Pass, wretched band! Well for the wakeful one if, riotously miserable, a fiercer tribe do not surround him‚Äîthe devils of a guilty heart that holds its hell within itself. What if Remorse should assume the features of an injured friend? What if the fiend should come in woman's garments with a pale beauty amid sin and desolation, and lie down by your side? What if he should stand at your bed's foot in the likeness of a corpse with a bloody stain upon the shroud? Sufficient without such guilt is this nightmare of the soul, this heavy, heavy sinking of the spirits, this wintry gloom about the heart, this indistinct horror of the mind blending itself with the darkness of the chamber. By a desperate effort you start upright, breaking from a sort of conscious sleep and gazing wildly round the bed, as if the fiends were anywhere but in your haunted mind. At the same moment the slumbering embers on the hearth send forth a gleam which palely illuminates the whole outer room and flickers through the door of the bedchamber, but cannot quite dispel its obscurity. Your eye searches for whatever may remind you of the living world. With eager minuteness you take note of the table near the fireplace, the book with an ivory knife between its leaves, the unfolded letter, the hat and the fallen glove. Soon the flame vanishes, and with it the whole scene is gone, though its image remains an instant in your mind's eye when darkness has swallowed the reality. Throughout the chamber there is the same obscurity as before, but not the same gloom within your breast. As your head falls back upon the pillow you think‚Äîin a whisper be it spoken‚Äîhow pleasant in these night solitudes would be the rise and fall of a softer breathing than your own, the slight pressure of a tenderer bosom, the quiet throb of a purer heart, imparting its peacefulness to your troubled one, as if the fond sleeper were involving you in her dream. Her influence is over you, though she have no existence but in that momentary image. You sink down in a flowery spot on the borders of sleep and wakefulness, while your thoughts rise before you in pictures, all disconnected, yet all assimilated by a pervading gladsomeness and beauty. The wheeling of gorgeous squadrons that glitter in the sun is succeeded by the merriment of children round the door of a schoolhouse beneath the glimmering shadow of old trees at the corner of a rustic lane. You stand in the sunny rain of a summer shower, and wander among the sunny trees of an autumnal wood, and look upward at the brightest of all rainbows overarching the unbroken sheet of snow on the American side of Niagara. Your mind struggles pleasantly between the dancing radiance round the hearth of a young man and his recent bride and the twittering flight of birds in spring about their new-made nest. You feel the merry bounding of a ship before the breeze, and watch the tuneful feet of rosy girls as they twine their last and merriest dance in a splendid ball-room, and find yourself in the brilliant circle of a crowded theatre as the curtain falls over a light and airy scene. With an involuntary start you seize hold on consciousness, and prove yourself but half awake by running a doubtful parallel between human life and the hour which has now elapsed. In both you emerge from mystery, pass through a vicissitude that you can but imperfectly control, and are borne onward to another mystery. Now comes the peal of the distant clock with fainter and fainter strokes as you plunge farther into the wilderness of sleep. It is the knell of a temporary death. Your spirit has departed, and strays like a free citizen among the people of a shadowy world, beholding strange sights, yet without wonder or dismay. So calm, perhaps, will be the final change‚Äîso undisturbed, as if among familiar things, the entrance of the soul to its eternal home.."}

        {"_id":{"$oid":"5e2d5aa31c9d4400006fb593"},"Title":"What is Greenwashing?","Author":"Adryan Corcione","Genre":"Non-Fiction","Words":{"$numberDouble":"1122"},"Content":"You've probably heard of whitewashing at least once in the corporate world. This term is defined as the glossing over or covering up of scandalous information through a biased presentation of facts. But greenwashing isn't nearly as well known. Greenwashing is when a company or organization spends more time and money on marketing themselves as environmentally friendly than on minimizing their environmental impact. It is a deceitful advertising gimmick intended to mislead consumers who prefer to buy goods and services from environmentally conscious brands. Greenwashing 101 Environmentalist Jay Westerveld coined the term \"greenwashing\" in 1986 in a critical essay inspired by the irony of the \"save the towel\" movement in hotels. The idea emerged in a period when most consumers received their news primarily from television, radio and print media, so they didn't have the luxury of fact-checking in the way we do today. Companies that have engaged in greenwashing on a wide scale have made headlines over the years. In the mid-1980s, for example, oil company Chevron commissioned a series of expensive television and print ads to broadcast its environmental dedication. But while the now-infamous \"The People Do\" campaign ran, Chevron was actively violating the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, as well as spilling oil into wildlife refuges. Chevron was far from the only corporation making outrageous claims, unfortunately. In 1991, chemical company DuPont announced its double-hulled oil tankers with ads featuring marine animals prancing in chorus to Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy.\" It turned out the company was the largest corporate polluter in the U.S. that year. How greenwashing harms a brand's reputation Greenwashing has changed over the last 20 years, but it's certainly still around. As the world increasingly embraces the pursuit of greener practices, corporate actors face an influx of litigation for misleading environmental claims. In February 2017, Walmart paid $1 million to settle greenwashing claims that alleged the nation's largest retailer sold plastics misleadingly touted as environmentally responsible. California state law bans the sale of plastics labeled as \"compostable\" or \"biodegradable,\" as environmental officials have determined such claims are misleading without disclaimers about how quickly the product will biodegrade in landfill.  Even the water industry tries to overrepresent its greenness. How many plastic bottles have you seen with colorful images of rugged mountains, pristine lakes and flourishing wildlife printed on their labels? \"The core theme has stayed the same,\" said Philip Beere, vice president of marketing at Sightline Payments. \"The No. 1 violation is embellishing the benefit of the product or service.\" Beere said he believes greenwashing is rarely caused by malicious plots to deceive, more often being the result of overenthusiasm. It's easy to see why marketers are enthusiastic: According to Nielsen's Global Corporate Sustainability Report, 66% of consumers would spend more on a product if it comes from a sustainable brand, and that figure jumps to 73% among millennials. How to avoid greenwashing With the belief that consumer demand for sustainability is the frontier of our transition to a greener, fairer and smarter global economy, Futerra's 2015 Selling Sustainability Report outlines 10 basic brand marketing tactics to avoid. Fluffy language: Words or terms with no clear meaning (e.g., \"eco-friendly\") Green products vs. dirty company: For example, efficient light bulbs made in a factory that pollutes rivers Suggestive pictures: Images that give an (unjustified) green impression (e.g., flowers blooming from exhaust pipes) Irrelevant claims: Emphasis on one tiny green attribute when everything else is anti-green \"Best-in-class\" boasts: Declaration that you are slightly greener than the rest, even if the rest are pretty terrible Designations that are just not credible: For instance, the \"greening\" of a dangerous product to make it seem safe (\"eco-friendly\" cigarettes, anyone?) Gobbledygook: Jargon and information that only a scientist could check or understand Imaginary friends: A label that looks like a third-party endorsement ‚Ä¶ except it's made up No proof: A claim that could be right but has no evidence Outright lies: Totally fabricated claims or data There are plenty of wonderful companies telling their environmental stories to the world, and even some that aren't but should be. The incidence of \"pure greenwash\" ‚Äì purposeful untruths on impact of products ‚Äì is not that prominent. However, there's a lot out there that comes close. Beere describes the buzzwords commonly used to greenwash as a \"slippery slope\" and advises any company to invest in educating their marketers on the ethics of \"green\" branding. Difference between green marketing and greenwashing There is a fine line between green marketing and greenwashing. Unlike greenwashing, green marketing is when companies sell products or services based on legitimate environmental positives. Green marketing is generally practical, honest and transparent, and it means that a product or service meets these criteria: Manufactured in a sustainable fashion Free of toxic materials or ozone-depleting substances Able to be recycled and/or is produced from recycled materials Made from renewable materials (such as bamboo) Does not use excessive packaging Designed to be repairable rather than disposable However, it's easy for green marketing to translate to greenwashing in practice, when an organization doesn't live up to the standards of sustainable business practices. \"Eco-friendly,\" \"organic,\" \"natural\" and \"green\" are just some examples of the widely used labels that can be confusing and misleading to consumers. If you're ready to slap some grass on your logo, be transparent with customers about your company's practices and have information readily available to back it up. Greenwashing in corporate social responsibility \"Greenwashing is actually in a corporation's best interest,\" said Deandra Jefferson, office manager at a sustainability organization that she requested go unnamed, in an interview with Business News Daily. \"Although the concept of corporate social responsibility exists, it is very rare that corporations actually live up to them, and when they do, it's a surface-level effort to make themselves look good.\" In other words, greenwashing benefits a corporation only when they are successful in deceiving their customers, Jefferson said. Transparency can bridge the gap between artificial and genuine concern for the environment. One example of transparency is activist outdoor clothing retailer Patagonia. Unlike most companies, Patagonia doesn't sugarcoat its use of chemicals or the fact that it leaves a footprint. The company's sustainability mission is described as a \"struggle to become a responsible company.\" \"We can't pose Patagonia as the model of a responsible company,\" its website reads. \"We don't do everything a responsible company can do, nor does anyone else we know. But we can tell you how we came to realize our environmental and social responsibilities, and then began to act on them.\" Do your best to tell your company's sustainability story and avoid greenwashing. It's a dirty practice, and we all know how costly a trip to the cleaners can be."}

Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired. Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people's children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it‚Äìnot like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field‚Äìthe Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home. Home! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided. And yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father. Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word: \"He is in Melbourne now.\" She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She tried to weigh each side of the question. In her home anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about her. Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business. What would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she had run away with a fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people listening. \"Miss Hill, don't you see these ladies are waiting?\" \"Look lively, Miss Hill, please.\" She would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores. But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like that. Then she would be married‚Äìshe, Eveline. People would treat her with respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been. Even now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father's violence. She knew it was that that had given her the palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for her like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for her dead mother's sake. And no she had nobody to protect her. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably. She always gave her entire wages‚Äìseven shillings‚Äìand Harry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had no head, that he wasn't going to give her his hard-earned money to throw about the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad on Saturday night. In the end he would give her the money and ask her had she any intention of buying Sunday's dinner. Then she had to rush out as quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and returning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to keep the house together and to see that the two young children who had been left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It was hard work‚Äìa hard life‚Äìbut now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life. She was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind, manly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home waiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit. It seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet her outside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to see The Bohemian Girl and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music and sang a little. People knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the lass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada. He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. \"I know these sailor chaps,\" he said. One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly. The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mothers bonnet to make the children laugh. Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing. She knew the air Strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she could. She remembered the last night of her mother's illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying: \"Damned Italians! coming over here!\" As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother's life laid its spell on the very quick of her being‚Äìthat life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother's voice saying constantly with foolish insistence: \"Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!\" She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save her. She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying something about the passage over and over again. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer. A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand: \"Come!\" All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing. \"Come!\" No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish. \"Eveline! Evvy!\" He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition.."}

        {"_id":{"$oid":"5e2d5ae61c9d4400006fb594"},"Title":"What Is Inflation?","Author":"Matt D'Angelo","Genre":"Non-Fiction","Words":{"$numberDouble":"1560"},"Content":"As a small business owner, you need to understand inflation and how it impacts your company. \"Inflation\" is a buzzword that most people have heard but few really understand. You might know that inflation has much to do with the price of goods and services, but you're not quite sure how they are related. Why does inflation occur, where does it come from, and why does inflation matter to small businesses?  What is inflation? Put simply, inflation is the rate at which the cost of goods and services rises over time. It could also be thought of as a reduction in the value of a dollar, because consumers are now able to purchase less than they previously could with the same dollar bill.   While the annual rate of inflation fluctuates each year, from 1913 to 2013 the U.S. experienced an average inflationary rate of 3.22%. That means, on average, something that costs $100 this year would cost $103.22 next year.   Inflation is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using several economic indexes, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Indexes (PPI). The CPI measures price changes from the perspective of the consumer, and tracks price changes in various goods and services. The PPI looks at price changes from the sellers' perspective by measuring the prices that companies pay for the raw materials that are used to produce goods. The PPI is useful, because inflation often begins in the supply chain when the cost of component parts goes up, for example. Manufacturers then charge more for their finished products.   The Federal Reserve actively works to maintain an inflation rate near 2%. When the rate gets significantly higher than the 2% target, the Federal Reserve can take several actions to try and slow economic growth, including raising interest rates.   While many people may think that all inflation is bad, economists argue that some controlled inflation is good for an economy. Inflation encourages spending, because when dollars are losing value, it provides a disincentive to save those dollars. Inflation also provides companies with the confidence to hire new employees. Inflation only becomes dangerous when it is uncontrolled and unexpected, increasing prices quickly to the point it grinds all spending (and, therefore, economic activity) to a halt.   The economy doesn't necessarily experience inflation every year. The opposite of inflation, deflation, is when prices go down, and the inflation rate falls below 0%. While you might think, \"Oh boy, lower prices,\" deflation is not usually a welcome thing. An indicator that economic conditions are deteriorating, deflation often results in lower levels of production and, ultimately, high rates of unemployment.  Types of inflation There are two main types of inflation: demand pull and cost push. Fueled by income and strong consumer demand, demand-pull inflation occurs when the economy demands more goods and services than are available. If demand skyrockets but supply, or the overall amount of goods and services, remains the same, the demand pulls the prices for things up.   Imagine you own a bagel shop in your local town. If your community is doing well financially and people love your bagels, the demand for them will increase. If you can't produce any more bagels because you don't have enough ovens, the amount of bagels you can sell remains the same. But people want more of them, thus the value of your bagels increases, and so can your price. This is a very simple example. Demand-pull inflation occurs on a grand scale across an entire economy.   Cost-push inflation happens when the demand for goods increases because production costs rise to the point where fewer goods can be produced. As demand remains the same but the cost of supply increases, the price is pushed upward by supply costs. In the context of the bagel store, imagine if people love your bagels and want to buy them, but a law has changed where you have to pay higher wages to your workers. Higher wages means it costs more for you to produce each bagel, which means you'll have to push prices higher to cover your costs.   These are the two basic types of inflation. Inflation can combine, however, with other market forces to create an entirely new economic phenomenon. Other types of inflation include hyperinflation, a rapid and out-of-control form of inflation; pricing power inflation, which occurs when businesses raise prices to increase profits; sectoral inflation, which is when the rising prices are confined to just one industry; and stagflation, which occurs when inflation is rising despite slow economic growth.  History of inflation While the inflation rate has ranged from 1.5 and 3.5% for the past two decades, it has fluctuated a great deal in the years before. While inflation rates have only been tracked officially for the past 100 years, it played a significant role in the economy in the years well before that.   Between 1775 and 1865, inflation was blamed for two U.S. currency collapses: the Continental currency during the Revolutionary War and Confederation notes during the Civil War. In the last century, inflation rates have spiked to 18% in 1918, 15.6% in 1920 and 14.4% in 1947. Inflation in the United States has only risen above 10% twice since 1980. It topped out at 13.5% in 1980, and a year later, it reached 10.3%.   Since the financial crisis in 2008, inflation has remained below 2.5% every year. The Federal Reserve aims to remain a target rate of 2% inflation annually, and now that the economy is stable and growing at a gradual but healthy rate, the Fed is slowly hiking interest rates in a bid to manage anticipated inflation.   As an entrepreneur, you should plan and strategize for inflation before it arrives. In a largely recovered economy, now is the time to lay those plans.  How does inflation affect interest rates? Inflation is an important concept for small business because it affects interest rates, which impacts how much it costs to borrow money. At the heart of the relationship between inflation and interest rates are real and nominal interest rates. Nominal interest rates are the interest rates advertised by your bank. They are, for example, the interest accrued on your savings in your savings account. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation.   In an economic scenario where there is 3% inflation and you have a variable rate interest loan at 10% interest that's adjusted for inflation, the real interest rate you will pay is 13%. In other words, inflation can end up costing you more money.   This is one way interest is impacted by inflation. The other is inflation can impact the federal funds rate. This rate, determined by the Federal Reserve Bank, is the basis for loans throughout the United States. When the federal funds rate is low, interest rates are low and borrowing money costs less, which drives up inflation. When the federal funds rate is high, interest rates are high and it's more expensive to borrow money, which is a measure that can help curb inflation.  How does the Federal Reserve Bank stop inflation? The Federal Reserve Bank influences the economy through several measures, one of which is the federal funds rate. The fed funds rate has a direct impact on inflation. As described above, it serves as the basis for all loans throughout the United States. It is, essentially, the market value for money within the economy at any given time. If the Fed raises the fed funds rate, money is more expensive to borrow and fewer people will be inclined to take out loans, thus lowering inflation. When the fed funds rate is low, borrowing money is inexpensive and consumers are incentivized by the low price to take out loans.   This is the basic way that the Federal Reserve Bank controls inflation. There are several other scenarios where the Fed can control inflation and economic activity in the United States, as with quantitative easing during the financial crisis of 2008. As a small business owner, it's imperative to be aware of market forces as you take out loans and conduct business operations. This means tuning into financial news about the Federal Reserve and fed funds rate activity.  How can you protect your business from inflation? Inflation is a market force that you cannot control, so it's important to have both proactive and reactive strategies to inflation. This all starts with staying informed: If the fed funds rate is low, it's a good time to take out a loan. If it's high, it may be better to wait until it comes down.   If inflation is coming and experts are expecting prices of goods to rise, there are a few strategies you can implement to protect your business. The main goal, however, should be to free up as much capital as possible to weather increasing prices.   Reduce debt. You'll need more cash on hand to deal with the rising costs of inflation. If you can consolidate debt or pay off creditors before a spike in inflation, you can remain financially flexible.  Optimize business efficiency. Consolidate departments, rethink business processes, adjust expectations, and do your best to stay lean.  Rethink your suppliers. Consider who you're working with on the supply side of your business, and do your best to cut costs where possible.."}

His parents were Christians, and by them, and especially by his mother, he was most carefully instructed and trained. When the youth came to the age of seventeen years he took up the profession of arms, and since he was gifted with beauty of person, intelligence, and an exquisite courtesy, he rose rapidly to a considerable military rank. Especially he pleased his imperial master, Diocletian. One day while the Emperor, who was devoted to the worship of Apollo, was consulting at a shrine of that god upon an affair of much importance, from the dark depths of the cavern came forth a voice saying, \"The just who are on the earth keep me from telling the truth. By them the inspiration of the Sacred Tripod is made a lie.\" At once the Emperor was stricken with consternation and asked who these just people were. \"Master,\" answered one of the priests of Apollo, \"they are the Christians.\" This answer so enraged Diocletian that he rekindled his persecutions. Now from the first the young soldier George had burned with indignation because of the unspeakable cruelties put upon Christians, and he had spoken out boldly in defence of his brethren. His friends had counselled silence and prudence. But George would have none. He knew, however, that he might be called upon to suffer at any time, and he hoped to do better work for the world and to die after braver effort. He therefore distributed his money and his fine apparel among the poor and needy, set free all the slaves he possessed, and went forth upon knightly travel. While pricking one day through the plains of Libya he came to a certain city called Silene, the people of which were bewailing a dire misfortune that had come upon them. An enormous dragon had issued from a marsh neighbouring the town and had devoured all their flocks and herds. Already the monster had taken dwelling near the city walls, and at such distance the people had been able to keep him only by granting him two sheep every day for his food and drink. If they had failed in this he would have come within their walls and poisoned every man, woman, and child with his plague-like breath. But now already all the flocks and herds had been eaten. Nothing remained to fill the insatiable maw of the dragon but the little people of the homes and hearths of all the town. Every day two children were now given him. Each child taken was under the age of fifteen, and was chosen by lot. Thus it happened that every house and every street and all the public squares echoed with the wailing of unhappy parents and the cries of the innocents who were soon to be offered. Now it chanced that the King of the city had one daughter, an exceeding fair girl both in mind and body, and after many days of the choosing of lots for the sacrifice, and after many a blooming girl and boy had met an unhappy death, the lot fell to this maiden, Cleodolinda. When her father, the King, heard his misfortune, in his despair he offered all the gold in the state treasury and even half his kingdom, to redeem the maiden. But at this many fathers and mothers who had lost their children murmured greatly and said, \"O King, art thou just? By thy edict thou hast made us desolate. And now behold thou wouldst withhold thine own child!\" Thus the people spake, and speaking they waxed wroth greatly, and so joining together they marched threatening to burn the King in his palace unless he delivered the maiden to fulfil her lot. To such demands the King perforce submitted, and at last he asked only a delay of eight days which he might spend with the lovely girl and bewail her fate. This the people granted. At the end of the time agreed to the fair victim was led forth. She fell at her father's feet asking his blessing and protesting she was ready to die for her people. Then amid tears and lamentations she was led to the walls and put without. The gates were shut and barred against her. She walked towards the dwelling of the dragon, slowly and painfully, for the road was strewn with the bones of her playmates, and she wept as she went on her way. It was this very morning that George, courageously seeking to help the weak, and strong to serve the truth, was passing by in his knightly journeying. He saw stretched before him the noisome path, and, moved to see so beautiful a maiden in tears, he checked his charger and asked her why she wept. The whole pitiful story she recounted, to which the valiant one answered, \"Fear not; I will deliver you.\" \"Oh noble youth,\" cried the fair victim, \"tarry not here lest you perish with me. Fly, I beseech you.\" \"God forbid that I should fly,\" said George in answer; \"I will lift my hand against this loathly thing, and I will deliver you through the power that lives in all true followers of Christ.\" At that moment the dragon was seen coming forth from his lair half flying and half crawling towards them. \"Fly, I beseech you, brave knight,\" cried the fair girl trembling, \"Leave me here to die.\" But George answered not. Rather he put spurs to his horse and, calling upon his Lord, rushed towards the monster, and, after a terrible and prolonged combat, pinned the mighty hulk to the earth with his lance. Then he called to the maiden to bring him her girdle. With this he bound the dragon fast, and gave the end of the girdle into her hand, and the subdued monster crawled after them like a dog. Walking in this way they approached the city. All the onlooking people were stricken with terror, but George called out to them saying, \"Fear nothing. Only believe in Christ, through whose help I have conquered this adversary, and live in accord with His teachings, and I will destroy him before your eyes.\" So the King and the people believed and such a life they endeavoured to live. Then St. George slew the dragon and cut off his head, and the King gave great treasure to the knight. But all the rewards George distributed among the sick and necessitous and kept nothing for himself, and then he went further on his way of helpfulness. About this time the Emperor Diocletian issued an edict which was published the length and breadth of his empire. This edict was nailed to the doors of temples, upon the walls of public markets, in all places people frequented, and those who read it read it with terror and hid their faces in despair. For it condemned all Christians. But St. George when he saw the writing was filled with indignation. That spirit and courage which comes to all of us from communion with the eternal powers heartened and strengthened him, and he tore down the unhappy utterance and trampled it under foot. Thus prepared for death George approached the Emperor. \"What wouldst thou?\" cried Diocletian angrily, having heard from his proconsul Dacian that this young man deserved torture. \"Liberty, sir, for the innocent Christians,\" answered the martyr. \"At the least liberty, since their liberty can hurt no one.\" \"Young man,\" returned Diocletian with threatening looks, \"think of thine own liberty and thy future.\" Before George could make answer the ill-will of the tyrant waxed to ardent hatred and he summoned guards to take the martyr to prison. Once within the dungeon the keepers threw him to the ground, put his feet in stocks and placed a stone of great weight upon his chest. But even so, in the midst of torture, the blessed one ceased not to give thanks to God for this opportunity to bear witness to Christ's teachings. The next day they stretched the martyr on a wheel full of sharp spokes. But a voice from heaven came to comfort him and said, \"George, fear not; so it is with those who witness to the truth.\" And there appeared to him an angel brighter than the sun, clothed in a white robe, who stretched out a hand to embrace and encourage him in his pain. Two of the officers of the prison who saw this beautiful vision became Christians and from that day endeavoured to live after the teachings of Christ. There is still another tale that after George had been comforted by the angel who descended from heaven, his tormentors flung him into a cauldron of boiling lead, and when they believed they had subdued him by the force of his agonies, they brought him to a temple to assist in their worship, and the people ran in crowds to behold his humiliation, and the priests mocked him. The Emperor, seeing the constancy of George, once more sought to move him by entreaties. But the great soldier refused to be judged by words, only by deeds. He even demanded to go to see the gods Diocletian himself worshipped. The Emperor, believing that at length George was coming to his right mind, and was about to yield, ordered the Roman Senate and people to assemble in order that all might be witnesses of George's acknowledgement of his own, Diocletian's, gods. When they were thus gathered together in the Emperor's temple, and the eyes of all the people were fixed upon the weak and tortured saint to see what he would do, he drew near a statue of the sun-god Apollo, and stretching out his hand toward the image he said slowly, \"Wouldst thou that I should offer thee sacrifices as to a god?\" The demon who was in the statue made answer, \"I am not God. There is but one God and Christ is his greatest prophet.\" At that very hour were heard horrible wailing sounds coming from the mouths of idols the world over, and the statues of the old gods either all fell over or crumbled to dust. One account says that St. George knelt down and prayed, and thunder and lightning from heaven fell upon the idols and destroyed them. Angry at the breaking of their power, the priests of the gods cried to the Emperor that he must rid himself of so potent a magician and cut off his head. The priests also incited the people to lay hands on the martyr. So it was commanded that George, the Christian knight, should be beheaded. He was dragged to the place of execution, and there, bending his neck to the sword of the executioner and absorbed in prayer, he received bravely and thankfully the stroke of death in April, 303. So stands St. George ever before the youth of the world, one of the champions of Christendom, a model of courage, a brave interceder for the oppressed, an example of pure, firm and enduring doing for others, a true soldier of Christ.."}

His talk was over; it was time for him to be off. But he did not want to go. Since he had retired, since his‚Ä¶ stroke, the wife and the girls kept him boxed up in the house every day of the week except Tuesday. On Tuesday he was dressed and brushed and allowed to cut back to the City for the day. Though what he did there the wife and girls couldn't imagine. Made a nuisance of himself to his friends, they supposed‚Ä¶ Well, perhaps so. All the same, we cling to our last pleasures as the tree clings to its last leaves. So there sat old Woodifield, smoking a cigar and staring almost greedily at the boss, who rolled in his office chair, stout, rosy, five years older than he, and still going strong, still at the helm. It did one good to see him. Wistfully, admiringly, the old voice added, \"It's snug in here, upon my word!\" \"Yes, it's comfortable enough,\" agreed the boss, and he flipped the Financial Times with a paper-knife. As a matter of fact he was proud of his room; he liked to have it admired, especially by old Woodifield. It gave him a feeling of deep, solid satisfaction to be planted there in the midst of it in full view of that frail old figure in the muffler. \"I've had it done up lately,\" he explained, as he had explained for the past how many weeks. \"New carpet,\" and he pointed to the bright red carpet with a pattern of large white rings. \"New furniture,\" and he nodded towards the massive bookcase and the table with legs like twisted treacle. \"Electric heating!\" He waved almost exultantly towards the five transparent, pearly sausages glowing so softly in the tilted copper pan. But he did not draw old Woodifield's attention to the photograph over the table of a grave-looking boy in uniform standing in one of those spectral photographers' parks with photographers' storm-clouds behind him. It was not new. It had been there for over six years. \"There was something I wanted to tell you,\" said old Woodifield, and his eyes grew dim remembering. \"Now what was it? I had it in my mind when I started out this morning.\" His hands began to tremble, and patches of red showed above his beard. Poor old chap, he's on his last pins, thought the boss. And, feeling kindly, he winked at the old man, and said jokingly, \"I tell you what. I've got a little drop of something here that'll do you good before you go out into the cold again. It's beautiful stuff. It wouldn't hurt a child.\" He took a key off his watch-chain, unlocked a cupboard below his desk, and drew forth a dark, squat bottle. \"That's the medicine,\" said he. \"And the man from whom I got it told me on the strict Q.T. it came from the cellars at Windsor Castle.\" Old Woodifield's mouth fell open at the sight. He couldn't have looked more surprised if the boss had produced a rabbit. \"It's whisky, ain't it?\" he piped feebly. The boss turned the bottle and lovingly showed him the label. Whisky it was. \"D'you know,\" said he, peering up at the boss wonderingly, \"they won't let me touch it at home.\" And he looked as though he was going to cry. \"Ah, that's where we know a bit more than the ladies,\" cried the boss, swooping across for two tumblers that stood on the table with the water-bottle, and pouring a generous finger into each. \"Drink it down. It'll do you good. And don't put any water with it. It's sacrilege to tamper with stuff like this. Ah!\" He tossed off his, pulled out his handkerchief, hastily wiped his moustaches, and cocked an eye at old Woodifield, who was rolling his in his chaps. The old man swallowed, was silent a moment, and then said faintly, \"It's nutty!\" But it warmed him; it crept into his chill old brain he remembered. \"That was it,\" he said, heaving himself out of his chair. \"I thought you'd like to know. The girls were in Belgium last week having a look at poor Reggie's grave, and they happened to come across your boy's. They're quite near each other, it seems.\" Old Woodifield paused, but the boss made no reply. Only a quiver in his eyelids showed that he heard. \"The girls were delighted with the way the place is kept,\" piped the old voice. \"Beautifully looked after. Couldn't be better if they were at home. You've not been across, have yer?\" \"No, no!\" For various reasons the boss had not been across. \"There's miles of it,\" quavered old Woodifield, \"and it's all as neat as a garden. Flowers growing on all the graves. Nice broad paths.\" It was plain from his voice how much he liked a nice broad path. The pause came again. Then the old man brightened wonderfully. \"D'you know what the hotel made the girls pay for a pot of jam?\" he piped. \"Ten francs! Robbery, I call it. It was a little pot, so Gertrude says, no bigger than a half-crown. And she hadn't taken more than a spoonful when they charged her ten francs. Gertrude brought the pot away with her to teach 'em a lesson. Quite right, too; it's trading on our feelings. They think because we're over there having a look round we're ready to pay anything. That's what it is.\" And he turned towards the door. \"Quite right, quite right!\" cried the boss, though what was quite right he hadn't the least idea. He came round by his desk, followed the shuffling footsteps to the door, and saw the old fellow out. Woodifield was gone. For a long moment the boss stayed, staring at nothing, while the grey-haired office messenger, watching him, dodged in and out of his cubby-hole like a dog that expects to be taken for a run. Then: \"I'll see nobody for half an hour, Macey,\" said the boss. \"Understand! Nobody at all.\" \"Very good, sir.\" The door shut, the firm heavy steps recrossed the bright carpet, the fat body plumped down in the spring chair, and leaning forward, the boss covered his face with his hands. He wanted, he intended, he had arranged to weep‚Ä¶ It had been a terrible shock to him when old Woodifield sprang that remark upon him about the boy's grave. It was exactly as though the earth had opened and he had seen the boy lying there with Woodifield's girls staring down at him. For it was strange. Although over six years had passed away, the boss never thought of the boy except as lying unchanged, unblemished in his uniform, asleep for ever. \"My son!\" groaned the boss. But no tears came yet. In the past, in the first months and even years after the boy's death, he had only to say those words to be overcome by such grief that nothing short of a violent fit of weeping could relieve him. Time, he had declared then, he had told everybody, could make no difference. Other men perhaps might recover, might live their loss down, but not he. How was it possible! His boy was an only son. Ever since his birth the boss had worked at building up this business for him; it had no other meaning if it was not for the boy. Life itself had come to have no other meaning. How on earth could he have slaved, denied himself, kept going all those years without the promise for ever before him of the boy's stepping into his shoes and carrying on where he left off? And that promise had been so near being fulfilled. The boy had been in the office learning the ropes for a year before the war. Every morning they had started off together; they had come back by the same train. And what congratulations he had received as the boy's father! No wonder; he had taken to it marvellously. As to his popularity with the staff, every man jack of them down to old Macey couldn't make enough of the boy. And he wasn't in the least spoilt. No, he was just his bright natural self, with the right word for everybody, with that boyish look and his habit of saying, \"Simply splendid!\" But all that was over and done with as though it never had been. The day had come when Macey had handed him the telegram that brought the whole place crashing about his head. \"Deeply regret to inform you ...\" And he had left the office a broken man, with his life in ruins. Six years ago, six years‚Ä¶ How quickly time passed! It might have happened yesterday. The boss took his hands from his face; he was puzzled. Something seemed to be wrong with him. He wasn't feeling as he wanted to feel. He decided to get up and have a look at the boy's photograph. But it wasn't a favourite photograph of his; the expression was unnatural. It was cold, even stern-looking. The boy had never looked like that. At that moment the boss noticed that a fly had fallen into his broad inkpot, and was trying feebly but desperately to clamber out again. Help! Help! said those struggling legs. But the sides of the inkpot were wet and slippery; it fell back again and began to swim. The boss took up a pen, picked the fly out of the ink, and shook it on to a piece of blotting-paper. For a fraction of a second it lay still on the dark patch that oozed round it. Then the front legs waved, took hold, and, pulling its small, sodden body up, it began the immense task of cleaning the ink from its wings. Over and under, over and under, went a leg along a wing as the stone goes over and under the scythe. Then there was a pause, while the fly, seeming to stand on the tips of its toes, tried to expand first one wing and then the other. It succeeded at last, and, sitting down, it began, like a minute cat, to clean its face. Now one could imagine that the little front legs rubbed against each other lightly, joyfully. The horrible danger was over; it had escaped; it was ready for life again. But just then the boss had an idea. He plunged his pen back into the ink, leaned his thick wrist on the blotting-paper, and as the fly tried its wings down came a great heavy blot. What would it make of that! What indeed! The little beggar seemed absolutely cowed, stunned, and afraid to move because of what would happen next. But then, as if painfully, it dragged itself forward. The front legs waved, caught hold, and, more slowly this time, the task began from the beginning. He's a plucky little devil, thought the boss, and he felt a real admiration for the fly's courage. That was the way to tackle things; that was the right spirit. Never say die; it was only a question of‚Ä¶ But the fly had again finished its laborious task, and the boss had just time to refill his pen, to shake fair and square on the new-cleaned body yet another dark drop. What about it this time? A painful moment of suspense followed. But behold, the front legs were again waving; the boss felt a rush of relief. He leaned over the fly and said to it tenderly, \"You artful little b‚Ä¶\" And he actually had the brilliant notion of breathing on it to help the drying process. All the same, there was something timid and weak about its efforts now, and the boss decided that this time should be the last, as he dipped the pen deep into the inkpot. It was. The last blot fell on the soaked blotting-paper, and the draggled fly lay in it and did not stir. The back legs were stuck to the body; the front legs were not to be seen. \"Come on,\" said the boss.\"Look sharp!\" And he stirred it with his pen in vain. Nothing happened or was likely to happen. The fly was dead. The boss lifted the corpse on the end of the paper-knife and flung it into the waste-paper basket. But such a grinding feeling of wretchedness seized him that he felt positively frightened. He started forward and pressed the bell for Macey. \"Bring me some fresh blotting-paper,\" he said sternly, \"and look sharp about it.\" And while the old dog padded away he fell to wondering what it was he had been thinking about before. What was it? It was‚Ä¶ He took out his handkerchief and passed it inside his collar. For the life of him he could not remember.."}

Earlier this month, Louisiana regulators approved an air quality permit that will allow the facility to pump 13.6 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. That's equivalent to adding 2.6 million cars to the road annually. No industrial facility in the United States reported emissions of that magnitude between 2011 and 2018, according to an E&E News review of EPA data. In 2018, only 13 coal plants emitted more. Sunshine is at the forefront of an often-overlooked boom in America's petrochemical sector, one that climate advocates worry could undo recent greenhouse gas reductions by locking in a new source of planet-warming pollution for decades to come. A recent study identified 88 petrochemical projects along the Gulf Coast that are either in the planning stage or under construction. If all are completed, their combined emissions output could reach 150.8 million metric tons, the equivalent of 38 coal plants. \"It is not something that has been on people's radars. When it comes to the oil and gas sector and emissions, we talk about upstream methane, and we talk downstream end use, tailpipes, electricity, etc.,\" said Andrew Waxman, an economics professor at the University of Texas, Austin, and a lead author of the study. Petrochemicals, he added, are \"not as big as a focus, and it should be part of the conversation.\" American greenhouse gas emissions have trended downward in recent years, largely thanks to the greening of U.S. power plants. The advent of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has unleashed a wave of cheap natural gas, prompting power companies to switch out their old, dirty coal units in favor of cleaner natural gas-burning replacements. Preliminary estimates suggest that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were down 2.1%. The decrease is almost entirely attributable to coal plant retirements. The same oil and gas boom that helped clean up the power sector has also made it cheaper to turn natural gas into plastics, fertilizer and other products. The process is emissions-intensive. Large quantities of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane are fed into enormous furnaces and heated to extremely high temperatures, creating smaller hydrocarbon molecules that can be separated and turned into different plastic products. Most of the new plants are along the Gulf Coast, where the infrastructure exists to transport gas to petrochemical facilities. But there are notable exceptions. Royal Dutch Shell PLC's construction of an ethane cracker outside Pittsburgh drew considerable attention last year after President Trump visited the facility. That plant was built to capitalize on the torrent of gas coming out of the Marcellus and Utica shale plays, which underlie parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. It will be allowed to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, roughly the emissions output of a combined-cycle natural gas plant. \"A lot of these petrochemical companies said, 'This is great; we have this cheap feedstock in our backyard,'\" said Jennifer Van Dinter, an analyst who tracks the sector at S&P Global Platts. A first wave of projects proposed around 2012 is now nearing completion, she said. The Sunshine Project complex is among the second wave of new petrochemical facilities.   'PLASTIC IS FOSSIL FUEL' Global plastic demand is increasingly driving the world's consumption of oil and gas. In 2018, the International Energy Agency reported that global petrochemical demand had nearly doubled since 2000, outpacing consumption of other bulk materials like steel, aluminium or cement. It found that petrochemical feedstocks accounted for about 12% of global oil demand. That figure is expected to rise in future years. Petrochemical demand is projected to account for a third of the growth in global oil demand by 2030 and rise to half by 2050. Traditionally, plastics have been seen as a conventional environmental concern, with greens focusing much of their efforts on waste. But climate hawks are increasingly alarmed by the sector's greenhouse gas emissions. A 2019 study by the Center for International Environmental Law concluded that emissions from global plastic production and incineration could reach 1.34 gigatons annually in 2030, roughly the amount of carbon dioxide released by 295 coal plants in a year. \"Plastic is fossil fuel in another form. Everything that happens before you see that plastic on the shelf is emissions intense. It releases all manner of pollutants and toxic chemicals,\" said Steven Feit, a lawyer at CIEL and contributor to the report. \"At the top level, dealing with the climate crisis requires dealing with the plastics crisis.\" Industry officials push back against those arguments. They note that plastics are used in everything from solar panels to car casings, helping make automobiles lighter and improving their fuel efficiency. The industry has backed a series of studies showing plastics do less environmental damage than alternatives like aluminum, glass and tin. One recent study by Trucost found that replacing plastics in consumer products and packaging would increase environmental costs from $139 billion to $533 billion annually. The American Chemistry Council, the industry's main lobbying arm, did not respond to requests for comment. In Louisiana, state and local officials have greeted petrochemical projects like Sunshine with open arms. With a price tag of $9.4 billion, the complex represents one of the largest private investments in the state's history. Formosa Plastics Group, the Taiwan-based petrochemical conglomerate behind the project, promises a jobs bonanza. Some 8,000 jobs are expected during construction. An additional 1,200 jobs paying an average wage of $84,500 will be created once it goes into operation, according to the company. The first stage of the project is expected to be completed by 2024, followed by the second stage in 2029. The complex will include a collection of ethane crackers and ethylene glycol, propylene and polypropylene plants designed to fabricate the plastic parts used to manufacture everything from water bottles and grocery bags to infant car seats and playground equipment. Janile Parks, a spokeswoman for the project, said Formosa's proposal represents a response to growing global demand for plastic and the falling cost of producing it. \"Low natural gas prices, coupled with Louisiana's extensive pipeline infrastructure, ensure that the natural gas that will be used as feedstock for the project will be abundant and competitively priced,\" she wrote in an email. 'MINISCULE' EFFECT ON WARMING The project highlights one of the difficulties in cutting emissions from the petrochemical sector. While power companies can turn to wind and solar and motorists can choose electric vehicles, there is no ready-made way to reduce greenhouse gases associated with the production of plastic. Nearly all of Sunshine's emissions stem from the combustion of natural gas, which is needed to operate the complex. Louisiana regulators determined that carbon capture and sequestration was technically feasible but concluded it would render the project uneconomical. Formosa has sought to downplay Sunshine's potential emissions impact. In a filing with state regulators, it noted that a rising tide of renewable energy is likely to green the facility's power supply. The company also said it is unlikely to hit its 13.6-million-ton permitting limit. That figure is based on running the facility at maximum capacity for a year. \"The expected contribution of the facility, when compared to national and global emissions, is miniscule,\" lawyers for Formosa subsidiary FG LA LLC wrote in comments to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. \"Thus it is logical to conclude that FG's potential contribution to climate change is also miniscule, assuming there are any effects at all and assuming FG's contribution could be accurately quantified.\" State regulators agreed. In their decision to approve Sunshine's air quality permit, they said it is difficult to determine the impact of an individual project on climate change. Carbon dioxide is drawn from sources worldwide and added to a swirling mix of gases in the atmosphere. \"As a result of this global mixing, GHGs emitted anywhere in the world affect climate everywhere in the world,\" the Department of Environmental Quality wrote. It added that the project will \"in effect have no more impact on Louisiana (relative to GHGs) than if the facility was constructed elsewhere, but will provide the social and economic benefits.\" A spokesperson for the state agency declined to comment. Sunshine's air quality permit puts it in an emissions class usually reserved for large coal plants. In 2018, only three industrial facilities reported carbon dioxide emissions in excess of 10 million tons, according to EPA data. They were a petrochemical plant operated by Ascend Performance Materials in Pensacola, Fla. (11.5 million tons); Exxon Mobil Corp.'s Baytown Complex, a refinery and petrochemical operation outside Houston (10.7 million tons); and an ArcelorMittal SA steel mill in Burns Harbor, Ind. (10.7 million tons). Environmental and local opposition to Sunshine has largely centered on its emissions of toxic pollutants, which include benzene, ethylene oxide and other cancer-causing gases. The project is sited next to a predominantly African American community in St. James Parish and is 1 mile from an elementary school. \"Formosa's planned complex is a disaster on several fronts, including climate change because it is a greenhouse gas giant, environmental justice given its decision to locate in a predominantly African American community already overburdened with industrial pollution, and public health due to the enormous amounts of cancer-causing emission,\" said Corinne Van Dalen, an attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental group opposed to the project. \"And for what? Plastic.\" Sunshine has now received its state and federal permits. Parks, the company spokeswoman, said it is now turning its focus to construction. But environmentalists are girding for a fight. The Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit in federal court last week challenging the plant's permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. More legal challenges are expected once Louisiana completes the formality of issuing Sunshine's air quality permit.."}
