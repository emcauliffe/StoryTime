# StoryTime â€“ DeltaHacks 2020 Project

## Inspiration
As kids we used to have time to read. We got lost in books enjoying the story of our favourite characters whenever we could. As we got older our reading time seems to have slipped away ... but our mindless social media scrolling has increased. What if we returned to reading? Even just 5 minutes a day? StoryTime gives us back our time to read.

## What it does
StoryTime asks you to answer a simple question: How much time do you have right now? You can effortlessly select a value between 1-9 minutes and instantly read a hand-picked story or news article straight from our servers. Like the stories you want to see more of and dislike the ones you don't. StoryTime makes it easy to start reading again and put the dull social media scroll behind us. One short story at a time.

## How we built it
We built StoryTime mainly in React-Native to take advantage of a singular, cross-platform code base. We also designed a back end system to interface with our app that allows us to keep our stories relevant and provide users a new story every time they open the app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of having a product to present. We are also extremely proud of the progress we made on learning entirely new things like back-end development. As it was the first hackathon for two of us, we are very happy with the result.

## What we learned
We learned how to create a back-end database, we learned the React-Native app development process, we learned about the best method to stack cups, we learned about how many hours (or lack thereof) of sleep we can operate on, and most importantly we learned that no challenge is too difficult to attempt.
